# Number-Guessing-Game
Guess the Number is a simple Java console-based game where the system generates a random number within a specified range (1–100). The user attempts to guess the number, and the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is higher or lower. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, tracking attempts and score.
